        <content type="html" xml:base="https://peterparkercode.github.io/blog/dark-night-of-soul/">&lt;p&gt;Going through the Dark Night of the Soul, can sometimes feel pretty scary‚Ä¶ the way that we‚Äôve perceived life is crumbling before our eyes. Everything from what we believed is to be to being revealed what the truth is either in our personal lives or looking what society is. All of these multiple factors were the reason why the Dark Night of the Soul happened to me. But why does this happen in the first place anyways? Is it because of those external factors that we may think is the reason why it‚Äôs all happening and blame the outside, or is it because that we chose to experience this in order to grow? When researching this topic and coming to that conclusion that I, myself either unconsciously or consciously chose to go through this in order to get rid of the beliefs that didn‚Äôt serve me. Which made all the sense to me, because I chose the path of questioning myself, reality and this world. I consciously chose to pursue spirituality and self development to connect with myself even more. Which the outcome of this was a feeling of being born again, spiritual bliss and life was amplified even more. It was like I put on a pair of lenses that made me see life as this beautiful thing, from the trees, to the animals, the connection I‚Äôve had and what not. But, this comes with the price of needing to know what the truth of this world or Matrix is. From seeing what the knowledge you‚Äôve gained as a gift, to now looking at it as a curse. When 2020 happened, that‚Äôs when I had to face the reality and consciously decided to look into ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù, who was behind the pandemic, wars, killings and things that have been enslaving humanity for centuries. With me wanting to know the truth and refusing the pretty lies, I‚Äôve gotten what I‚Äôve want. Thus the way I‚Äôve conveyed on what reality is as a kid, having to question even more on the matter, I realize it is a necessary part on one‚Äôs spiritual path and self development. Along with other factors taking place like separation I had from my friends because of lockdowns and not aligning with them anymore, as I‚Äôve questioned the very things that is hard to come to terms with, but it‚Äôs needed. But most importantly being in separation from the girl that I‚Äôve liked from the time, trying to reach out to keep our connection alive as the result was her admitting to avoided me, ghosting, running away and feelings of unrequited love, even though I still felt her presence when we weren‚Äôt talking at that time. All these factors, made me realize that I was in the Dark Night of the Soul. All I can say is to be patient on whatever you may have to face that you‚Äôve may have been unconsciously running your whole life or seeing things not being the same anymore. That‚Äôs what I most importantly feel but I promise, that things will get better, even if it seems bleak, keeping facing that feeling of hopelessness, heartbreak, fears etc. and integrating that shadow. Realize that you were and always are a complete whole being, this too shall past. Be self forgiving and have self patience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://peterparkercode.github.io/blog/reunited/">&lt;p&gt;this tension is building up inside of me&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to the point where I don‚Äôt know how to explain it within me&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;something about us sparked a flame that I would never forget&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;too bad we never commit, I think deep down is what we regret&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanna hug you tight&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fight for you right by your side&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;close off the outside world&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as we run in the beautiful night&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;looking into your eyes got me hypnotize&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reminiscing about that smile of yours&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it had some type of style&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel this energy that is bittersweet&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it tingles in my chest&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;someday I cannot rest&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thinking about this pain of our separation&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why we never open up&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we put up a facade that we‚Äôre doing okay&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but deep down we‚Äôre hurt&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes it feels like that the memories we had fade&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;though this thing that we have will never go away&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my intuition I know you still think about me by the days&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanna own up to my mistakes and forgive you and myself&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because I know this connection we had was a crazy experience that we felt&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like how you melt the insides of me as I blush and cry on how things ended&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this isn‚Äôt over as a new chapter has ascended and soon enough we will&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reunite as expected‚Ä¶&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://peterparkercode.github.io/blog/2021-25-04-heartbreak/">&lt;p&gt;I keep running away from the things that I need to face, being attached on with the past and I can‚Äôt run and hide forever. Made a lot of mistakes with that connection that could‚Äôve been something but it wasn‚Äôt mean‚Äôt to be. I‚Äôm still learning on how to move forward from it, which is still a challenge for me, reminsing about the times I had with her, mourning on what I lost. Though is it something that I really lost or that experince has already served its purpose and I returned it. That experince which had a lesson that I had to learn and still learning from. Theres things that is not in our control and others are in control. Its like a handful of cards that God, a higher power, universe etc. Gave us in life, that we have to accept, with the inevitable. Things don‚Äôt last forever family, friends, relationships all soon will have to come to an end at one point or another. The people in our lives and the foundation we build with them will soon, not have purpose anymore. Everything has purpose and we will have to move forward, return it and look towards a new sets of lessons in life that will have a new type of purpose. People change, the world is changing, and I have to come to accpetance that aye, she and I have, changed and even if it feels like we don‚Äôt know eachother anymore though thats life. And that makes me go into a deeper question, did I liked her for her, or the idea of her ü§î when it comes to my acceptance to what reailty is and not the fantasy and the things that are now the past&#x2F;memories? What is it that I can‚Äôt accept and move on from? Everything happens for a reason, I don‚Äôt believe in things being a ‚Äúcoincidence‚Äù and whoever made that word, must‚Äôve been too much of a rational and logical minded person, I wouldn‚Äôt like to hang out with üòÇ. Everything down with synchronicities, angel numbers, you thinking about something and that thing pops up, going through a bad day and some good karma comes to you, can‚Äôt be a coincdence. This ‚Äúlost‚Äù of a connection could be a blessing in disguise that I am not seeing? Is me holding on to that branch of the past and not letting go of it, blocking those blessings? Who knows until you actually let go of that branch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
